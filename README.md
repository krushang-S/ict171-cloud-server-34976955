I chose to create "The Recipe Room" because cooking is a central part of everyday life, and people are always looking for new, exciting, and easy-to-follow recipes. Whether someone is a beginner learning the basics or a passionate home cook exploring different cuisines, having a reliable and well-organized source of recipes can make a big difference.

The Recipe Room is designed to be a welcoming space where anyone can discover a wide variety of dishes—from quick weekday meals to traditional favorites and global cuisines.

I selected this topic because it combines my interest in food, creativity, and technology, while also offering something useful for a broad audience. It’s a project that has both personal meaning and practical value, with room to grow into a supportive online food community.
